## General description

    For this project we are implementing an application similar in functionality to Spotify, simulating different actions made by users, which can be normal, artists or hosts. These actions will be simulated using some commands received in the input files, and the implementation of the application will be done from the Admin perspective.
    
## Structure of the project

* src/
  * checker/ - checker files
  * fileio/ - contains classes used to read data from the json files
  * app/  - contains the packages that implement the application functionality
    * audio/ - manages audio inputs and all their properties
    * pages/ - contains the classes that implement the pagination
    * player/ - contains classes that manage the current source of a user
    * searchBar/ - classes that manage user searches
    * user/ - is responsible for storing user data and executing the commands generated by the user
    * utils/
    * Admin - stores the resources of the entire application and manages them 
    * CommandRunner - produces the messages corresponding to the commands and starts running them
  * main/
 
* input/ - contains the tests and library in JSON format
* ref/ - contains all reference output for the tests in JSON format

## Program flow

    The program manages user information and resources through the Admin class, while commands are handled by the CommandRunner class. During command execution, data is dynamically set for each user, including a player that tracks the currently played audio file, a list of favorite songs, and a page the user is on. Depending on the user type, additional features such as albums, playlists, or podcasts may be available.
    
    PageFactory class serves as a central component for generating diverse page objects based on user interactions. Utilizing a factory method, getPage, the class dynamically creates instances of various pages, such as Home, LikedContent, ArtistPage, and HostPage. The accompanying Page interface defines crucial methods for displaying current page content and facilitating smooth transitions between pages. This design promotes modular and extensible page management, enhancing code clarity and maintainability within the application.
